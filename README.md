# React Native Shopping Cart App

This React Native application showcases the use of fetch/axios for data fetching. On visiting the home screen, products are retrieved from the Fakestore API endpoint `/products` and displayed. Users can add products to their cart, with the total cost dynamically computed and displayed for checkout.

## Features
- Fetch and display products from an API.
- Add products to a cart.
- Calculate and display the total cost of the cart.
- Store cart data using AsyncStorage.
- Simple and intuitive navigation.

## Implementation Details
I chose to use AsyncStorage for managing cart data due to its suitability for small data sets. Navigation is set up in `App.js`, initially rendering the product list on the home screen. When a product is added to the cart, the cart list is updated, and the UI is refreshed to reflect these changes.
